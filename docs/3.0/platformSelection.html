<h3>Platform Selection</h3>

<p>If your tests are compiled x86 or x64, NUnit will run each assembly
by default in a process targeted at the appropriate platform as well as
the targeted runtime. If you run multiple assemblies in the same process,
you may not mix x86 and x64 assemblies.

<p>On an x64 machine, if your test assembly is compiled x86, you <b>must not</b>
use <b>/process=Single</b> on the command line. This is because NUnit is already
running in a 64-bit process and will  fail when it tries to load your assembly
into the same process.

<p>If your test assembly references any x86 or x64 assemblies, it should be built
the same platform. Consequently, you may not mix x86 and x64 references.
